 aCCJt12PQg0lcQURSvwdzA_2,  what's not to like
 HGoX8o35lTv8Z6eobtWpWw_25,  if everything i ordered was too salty for my taste than something's gotta give), but i think it had to be like that to help cover the "unfresh" aroma of the actual snail
 HGoX8o35lTv8Z6eobtWpWw_21,  just saying (;  my mussels were also a tad on the fishy side, the sauce a bit too salty for my liking but my fries were outta this world deeelicious ! although, i must say that they are definitely not french style frites

 pyfXJOxC3yvCb5HXoBlejQ_8,  there should be some additional seating by hostess stand for waiting or a better receiving/waiting area
 CZ5pNf3xDCm9tEaNT3s7yg_2,   a lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately
 dBruIGAkhOWGYSgIsY2ing_8,  one down note is that they only take reservations for inside seating which i find strange considering outside seating is more popular
 rFXzCS3PRE1cKUsT7I9VwA_2, 5*  there's no line on a weekday around lunchtime! made a reservation but there was plenty of outdoor seating :) i felt so lucky
 guclh5t3IL936JzdCiRUyw_4,   we did not want outdoor seating as it was 107 already

 0fBurYlsBOYRVCaQYU8XRg_3, i were seated right away
 Af8-BkdTo7ITR45afegKIQ_2,  after arriving to the restaurant at around 9pm, it was roughly an hour wait to be seated
 hQ_4gplsExcYX3lOcByw0Q_2, your final bill will be much lower than other restaurants right on the strip the outdoor patio is all the rage but you will probably have to wait for a while indoor seating is very nice
